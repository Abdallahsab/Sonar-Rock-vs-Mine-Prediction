# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

In this project, sonar sends and receives signals that echo from a specific cylinder and some rocks. The model here predicts whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock. An important step is that the sonar uses another sonar to send audio signals. The signal is then processed to determine whether the object is a mine or a rock.
